                     RadioMate - Radio Automation Made Easy
===============================================================================


Requirements
============

RadioMate has been developed and tested in the following environment:

- GNU/Linux (ArchLinux) w/ kernel 2.6.34 http://www.archlinux.org/
- Savonet Liquidsoap 0.9.2-2 http://savonet.sourceforge.net
- Python 2.6.5 http://www.python.org/
- MySQL 5.1.47 http://www.mysql.com/
- mysql-python 1.2.3c1-2 http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python
- apache 2.2.15 http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd


Structure
=========

At the moment, RadioMate has two main components: the radiomate.cgi CGI script
and the radiomated daemon.

For more details please see the README file.


Installation
============

- To install the radiomate python package, type from the command line: 
python setup.py install

- To initalize the MySQL database, the radiomate0.sql script is provided. It
  assumes that a database (for example called radiomate, has been created).
  Then, from the command line, it can be ran with:

mysql -u root -p radiomate < radiomate0.sql 

- an user foobar with password secret and with admin (i.e. all) privileges will
  be created.

- Copy the radiomateconfig.cgi file to your Web server's CGI directory.

- Copy radiomateconfig.sample.py to /etc/radiomateconfig.py and edit it to
  reflect your settings and preferences.
